The art/drawing half of this duo, and a full believer that there is more than one way to communicate science.

Currently she’s become especially obsessed with observing the origins of social organizations in insects.\n\r\r","permalink":"https://reviseandsubmit.github.io/about/","summary":"The Blog\rIf you are an academic and you are out socializing, at some point at least one person is going to passionately go on a tirade about how scientific communication should be more accessible to non-scientific folk.
