<h2>The Blog</h2>
<p>If you are an academic and you are out socializing, at some point at least one person is going to passionately go on a tirade about how scientific communication should be more accessible to non-scientific folk. Well this blog was made by two of those people. Here in Revise and Submit Sofía and Nadira take some of their ideas about how biology can be viewed in a tangible way and polish those ideas in to illustrated essay form.</p>

<p>Cognitive neuroscientist by day and artist… also by day… and night. The art/drawing half of this duo, and a full believer that there is more than one way to communicate science. When she’s not in the lab trying to unravel how the brain processes sequential behaviors using fMRI, she is philosophizing about science with friends in a weekly twitch stream.</p>

<p>Pun enthusiast, dad joke connoisseur and the writing half of this duo, Sofía is a PhD student at UC Davis who specializes in running after bees and observing their beehaviours. She believes that computational thinking is not just for computer scientists, and that many biological problems have computational solutions. Currently she’s become especially obsessed with observing the origins of social organizations in insects.</p>
